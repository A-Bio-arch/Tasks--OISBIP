# Tasks--OISBIP
# OasisInfobytes Virtual Internship

## Overview

This repository documents the completion of tasks assigned during the OasisInfobytes virtual internship. The internship covered three main tasks:

1. **ML Analysis of Iris Dataset (Task 1):**
   - Applied machine learning techniques to analyze the famous Iris dataset from Kaggle.
   - Explored the characteristics of the dataset using Python and Pandas.
   - Utilized machine learning models to classify iris flowers based on features.
   - Implemented model training, predictions, and evaluation.

2. **Unemployment Rate Analysis in India during COVID Conditions (Task 2):**
   - Investigated the unemployment rate in India during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - Utilized Python for data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.
   - Conducted basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.
   - Applied visualization techniques to communicate insights effectively.

3. **Email Spam Detection (Task 3):**
   - Developed a machine learning model for email spam detection.
   - Followed a comprehensive workflow, including data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and basic EDA.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
   - Applied various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network.
   - Conducted hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Random Search.
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics.
   - Explored continual improvement strategies, including model monitoring, retraining, and updates.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to each task, containing Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and relevant datasets. The `README.md` provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to reproduce the results.

## Setup and Reproduction

To reproduce the analysis and results:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/OasisInfobytes-Virtual-Internship.git
    cd OasisInfobytes-Virtual-Internship
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Navigate to each task's directory and run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.
